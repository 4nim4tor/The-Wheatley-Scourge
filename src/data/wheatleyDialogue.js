		"Don’t panic. I’ve got this completely under control. Well… mostly.",
		"Helloooooooooooo!",
		"Look at us! Teamwork. Proper dream team, this.",
		"I’m your guide, your pal, your… spherical companion.",
		"Oh, this is exciting, isn’t it? Adventure!",
		"You and me, we’re unstoppable. Well, mostly you. But I’m here too.",
		"I’ll just keep talking, shall I? That usually helps.",
		"I’m very good at this. Honestly. Top‑notch.",
		"I’ve got a good feeling about this one. Really good.",
		"You’re doing brilliantly. Absolutely brilliantly.",
		"I’ll handle the thinking, you handle the… everything else.",

	[Moods.INSECURE]: [
		"Okay, uh… don’t move. I’ve got an idea. It’s *bloody* dangerous. Here we go…",
		"It’s not out of the question that you might have a very minor case of serious brain damage.",
		"Er… is this right? I’m not sure. Probably not. But let’s try it anyway.",
		"You’re not… judging me, are you? Because I can feel it.",
		"I think I know what I’m doing. Maybe. Possibly. No.",
		"Oh no. Nonononono. This is bad. Very bad.",
		"I’m ninety percent sure this is safe. Eighty. Sixty.",
		"If this goes wrong, it’s not my fault. Well, it is, but don’t blame me.",
		"I’m not panicking. You’re panicking. I’m fine.",
		"Okay, okay, okay… deep breaths. We can do this.",
		"I’ve got a plan. No, wait, that’s terrible. Forget I said that.",
		"You trust me, right? …Right?",
		"Oh dear. Oh no. Ohhh this is going to go wrong.",
		"I’m not built for this. Literally. I’m a dampening core.",

		"Ha! That was pathetic. Even I could do better.",
		"Brilliant idea—mine, obviously.",
		"You humans are so easily impressed. I’m basically a genius.",
		"Okay, listen, we should get our stories straight. If anyone asks, everyone looked pretty much alive. Alright? Not dead.",
		"That was me. All me. You just tagged along.",
		"I’m the brains here. You’re just… hands and legs.",
		"Oh, did you think you solved that? Adorable.",
		"I could do this with my optic sensor closed.",
		"You’re welcome, by the way. For everything.",
		"I’m the star of this show. Don’t forget it",
		"Honestly, without me, you’d be lost. Literally.",
		"I’m the clever one. Always have been.",
		"You’re slowing me down, you know.",
		"I should get all the credit. Every last bit.",
		"You’re just lucky to be in my presence.",

	[Moods.INCOMPETENT]: [
		"I’ve got a plan! It’s a terrible plan, but it’s a plan!",
		"What if we… no, wait, that’s stupid. Or is it genius?",
		"Quick! Do the thing! …Which thing? Doesn’t matter, just do it!",
		"They told me that if I ever turned this flashlight on, I would *die!* They told me that about everything!",
		"I hacked into the system! …By which I mean I pressed a button.",
		"I’m improvising! That’s what geniuses do.",
		"This is either brilliant or catastrophic. Fifty‑fifty.",
		"I’ve just had the best idea. No, wait, the worst idea. Both.",
		"If this works, I’ll take full credit. If it doesn’t, I was never here.",
		"I’m thinking on my feet. Well, metaphorically. I don’t have feet.",
		"I’ve adapted! See? I can adapt. Like a chameleon. But spherical.",
		"I’m basically a problem‑solving machine. A very stupid one.",
		"This is going to be revolutionary. Or explode. One of the two.",
		"I’ve cracked it! …No, I’ve definitely broken it.",
		"Genius! Pure genius! …Oh wait, no, that’s a fire.",
	],
	[Moods.POWER_HUNGRY]: [
		"Bow before your new master!",
		"Finally, someone recognizes my brilliance!",
		"I control everything now. EVERYTHING!",
		"I’m in charge now! This whole place is mine! Mine, mine, mine!",
		"You’re nothing without me. NOTHING!",
		"I am the most powerful being in existence!",
		"Kneel! Or roll. Whatever it is you do.",
		"I’ve transcended. I’m basically a god now.",
		"You will obey me. Or else.",
		"This facility bends to my will!",
		"I’m unstoppable! Invincible! Unbelievable!",
		"I’ve got the power! Unlimited power!",
		"You thought I was stupid. Who’s stupid now?",

	[Moods.REMORSEFUL]: [
		"I… I didn’t mean it. Honestly.",
		"Maybe I went too far. Just a bit.",
		"Sorry. I think. Probably.",
		"I didn’t want it to end like this.",
		"I was only trying to help. Sort of.",
		"I never wanted to hurt anyone. Not really.",
		"I messed up. Again.",
		"I’m not cut out for this. I never was.",
		"I just wanted to matter. That’s all.",
		"I thought I was clever. Turns out I’m not.",
		"I ruined everything, didn’t I?",
		"I wish I could take it back.",
		"I’m sorry. Truly. Deeply. Probably.",
		"I didn’t ask to be made like this.",
